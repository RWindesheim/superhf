It never bothered me that she received messages and replied to them and flirted with other men because it was open and there was no deceit.\\n\\nI recently found out that she has been sending messages to some of her 'fans' from another Reddit account that I don't have access too (found out as she left it logged in on my iPad), specifically so I can't see the messages - she says that in her messages.\\n\\nThere is one person in particular who she talks to a lot, most days. As far as I saw there was nothing very sexual in her messages (just him complementing her on her r/gonewild posts), but they were very affectionate toward each other. He would say how he hoped they could be together one day, how much he misses her, she said that he's one of the few people that she feels she can talk to and feels comfortable with.\\n\\nFor full disclosure, we had a problem a few months back that I was chatting explicitly to other women via social media and it almost caused the end of our relationship. I'm not proud of it, and I'm doing everything I can to make it right.\\n\\nSo what do I do? I haven't confronted her as she's more than entitled to have a friend I don't know about and speak to them in confidence. Should I be worried? Maybe she's trying to get back at me?\\n\\nLet me know what you think. Thank you for reading.\", 'I was at Subway a while back, and while I was thinking of what to get, the guy ahead of us was paying. There was some sort of deal of buying one type of sub, get another free. He had a coupon too, but the clerk denied the coupon because there was an ambiguity with whether or not the coupon was allowed with other deals. At this time, the subs were already made, he was paying, but not for both. The customer decided to only pay for one, and asked for the other free since it was made and the clerk had to throw it away. The clerk denied it. This argument went on for a while and ended up in the clerk just eating the sub in front of the customer.', \"I guess I don't know how to ask this exactly because I don't know *exactly* how to classify thought.\\n\\nBut I suppose I mean this:\\n\\nWhat is the most close a computer has ever come to reasoning?  I'm not talking about data checks based on programmed algorithms, but actually creating a new algorithm or process that was never programmed into it?\\n\\nI suppose the ability to actually learn something is in question?  has it ever happened?  I don't mean programmed adaptation, like in the case of some machines that pick up certain patterns they were programmed to look for, but actual new things being done by the computer?\\n\\nhas anything even close to this EVER happened? or is it only in sci-fi currently?\", \"Hey there Reddit,\\n\\nHere's the deal. I've been living in an apartment for a about a year now. For the last 2 months or so, my upstairs neighbours (who I've never met) have had a dog living with them who occasionally goes outside onto their balcony (directly above mine) and pees. Our balcony floors are wooden slats, so some of it drips though onto mine.\\n\\nI'm not sure if it happens all the time because I work full time, but I think it might because sometimes I come home and their are very small puddles of liquid (which I'd presumed to be water) on my balcony, even if it hasn't rained. This being the case I think that they may have trained the dog to pee outside without really considering (or caring) that they've essentially trained their dog to pee on me.\\n\\nObviously this is not the greatest of situations, and I want to send them a note or contact them in some way so that it can stop. The only problem is that I don't really know how to approach it. I want to be firm and be clear that it's unacceptable, but also not come off as a busy body or too aggressive given that I've never even spoken to them before.\\n\\nHowever, there is one slight problem. My housemates and I have cats. They are both fully house trained (they only ever do their business in their litter) and are never allowed outside onto the balcony without one of us present. Our building doesn't allow pets, but our actual landlord said he didn't mind us getting some before we got the cats. I just want to be careful that I don't piss off the people living upstairs so that they don't rat us out for our cats and leave us so we have to get rid of them or move. I'm not even sure the people living upstair know we have cats since the cats are rarely outside, and we rarely see our neighbours outside either.\", 'So now that I am about to finish high school in the Austrian School in Guatemala (central america) I really want to study medicine and become a doctor and help my country in the future.

I've never had problems with relationships before and I'm a pretty good boyfriend when dating. \\nHowever, I haven't dated anyone in 3 years because during my last relationship when I was 20, I suffered penile trauma and my sex life changed dramatically since then. I tore a ligament that suspends your erect penis and there is no cure or medical procedure. The injury and subsequent effects caused me to have a lot of resentment with the girl I was dating and we broke up. \\n\\nNow I am having troubles keeping an erection, especially the second erection after initial intercourse, and I don't last that long anymore. After ejaculating once, I usually can't get much of an erection for quite a few hours. This is due to plaque build up due to my injury and a restriction of blood flow to my penis. My doctor has recommended that I don't go on ED meds because I'm so young. Also, if I have sex too much, I have a lot of pain in my penis. \\n\\nHowever, I love going down on a woman and would gladly do that multiple times a day if it keeps her happy. I also would be open to everything in the bedroom to make up for what I may not be able to provide. \\n\\nBasically- I'm struggling as to whether I can even be in a relationship or not. I really want to start dating and to have a special someone if my life, but I don't know if I can provide the sexual side of a relationship anymore. If I am to meet someone, when is the appropriate time to tell her something like this? It's obviously a very personal thing and could alter her desire to be in a relationship with me, but it's not something I can keep a secret as it affects my sexual abilities a lot. \\n\\nI'm not looking for medical advice. I just want your personal opinions on relationship prospects. What if a guy were to tell you this? What would your reactions be?\", 'So here\\'s the thing. While living in Ireland and attending an Irish secondary school, there is no bigger stigma than being someone who is \\'a frigdit\\' i.e someone who has never kissed (or in ireland, \\'shifted\\') someone.

I have no real intention of continuing in a relationship with this girl after the shift, but due to my lack of experience, I have no idea what to do.

Within two years of dating, he started talking about getting married one day, but I said that I wanted to finish our degrees, first. Starting about a year ago, in our final year of our undergrad degrees, he was telling our mutual friends that he was going to start saving for an engagement ring. This continued right through the summer. \\n\\nThis September, we both began graduate programs and started to see one another less than we had before. In December, he broke up with me. Nothing big happened to cause the breakup aside from drifting apart a bit (which I felt was natural given our grad programs); I think that he just didn't know what he wanted in life. I really don't think it's about other people--we've been broken up for two months and neither one of us has rebounded or expresses any interest in doing so. I still love him with all my heart, and I think that we both feel that we have unfinished business. We speak on a regular basis and are both on the same page: we love one another, we're *in* love, we're sexually compatible, and we hope to be together again one day.\\n\\nWhat could cause someone to cause to get cold feet/change their mind enough to go from wanting to propose to wanting to break up? Has this happened to any of you? \\n\\nI'd respectfully ask that everyone refrains from ex-bashing on this thread.

On top of that I’d like to ask whether there is anything more I could be doing, or anything I should be doing differently.\\n\\nSo I’m 22, and a fully payed off homeowner in the UK. Currently this home is being rented to 4 students and pulls in about £1500 a month in rental income. On top of this, I work a decent steady job, making £22500 a year before tax. I keep these 2 incomes separate, as my parents frequently need to use some or all of the rental income for the near future. My job income is how I live and all of my current savings are spent on flights to the US to see my girlfriend as often as possible.\\n\\nSo here is the plan; In the next 12 months I plan to move to the USA, this will be by marrying my girlfriend. Once there, I am fairly confident I can get a decent job that can provide for both of us (at that point I’d be a 1 year graduated software engineer). In the next 6 months I plan on buying a house where I work in the UK on a mortgage, living there until I move to the states then renting it out from there, using the rental income to pay off the mortgage, and whatever is left from the student rented property.\\n\\nEssentially, I’d like to earn my living through property eventually, and for the lifestyle I would like to live, this would mean probably making £150-£200k a year from it. In the meantime I’ll work a job to live and keep rolling property into more property until I have roughly 10 fully payed off.

If you have a clear and pure conscience and you have lived a wholesome life, your last 7 minutes will be manifested with everything you have ever desired (heaven). If you have lived an evil life, your manifestation will reflect as such. Simply put, you make your own hell. There is no divine intervention, no heavely father. None of that is real.

I work full-time right now and need a pretty flexible schedule, so I’ve been looking for places that are open late. So, I sent an e-mail to a local club and asked if they were looking for any waitresses. It’s like three clubs in one- one side is a bar, one is a dance club and the other has “live performances” (strippers and local bands).They e-mailed me back immediately and said they had openings in the strip club for waitresses and bartenders.\\n\\nI’m not in any position to turn down a paying job so I asked how I would go about applying. I'm young, I don't mind wearing skimpy clothes and the tips are great. I received an e-mail back asking when I could come in for an interview. I told them I was available whenever and they asked me to stop by the clubs that evening.\\n\\nI met the owner in the bar and he asked me a few questions before saying “When can you start?”. I told him “Uh, this week? I can work Wednesdays and Thursdays, along with every second weekend starting after May long weekend” and he said “Okay sounds good”. He then asked for my phone number and said he would give me a text before my start date with everything I needed to bring.\\n\\nI “interviewed” on Friday and it’s now Monday. This was all so informal that I want to confirm that I’ll be starting there this week and that they will adhere to my schedule.

I'm a law student, but now I know that I don't like it and I'm in the middle of course. And the worst part is that in my country, if you want to change what you are studying at college you have to do a really hard test about general knowledge and I don't have the time and energy to study for this anymore.\\n\\nI like my family, but other than my parents, I don't really have any connection to anyone in my family. I have a lot of friends, but I only truly trust one or two of them. I doubt that I will ever miss any of the others.\\n\\nI am single and the only really interesting girl that I met in the last few years is this girls that lives in another country (different continent).\\n\\nSo basically I hate how my life is right now and I'm not sure what to do. I wanted to restart, but I'm not sure how. I thought about randomly going to some other country (US, Australia or somewhere in Europe) and just trying to get a job there and study something.

I got over the relationship for the most part, some random things can still make me feel sad about it but for he most part I'm ok. I've met a few girls since going to college and am good friends with a few. I was asked to go to a hall meeting for my hall(basically event planning for the hall) i agreed and went. The meeting was quite boring until i noticed this amazingly beautiful girl sitting across from me. During most of the meeting we made eye contact where we neither of us looked away for quite a while. I am not the most confident guy and am quite shy. Having been in a relationship for 2 years  of which my ex was the one that asked me out, i don't really know what i'm doing or what i should do. I havent talked to her at all and she doesnt have any classes with me but i know her name because she is a RA for one of the floors in my building.
